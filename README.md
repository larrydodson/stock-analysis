## 1. Overview of Project
### **Purpose**

  The primary purpose of the project is to utilize VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) coding script language to prepare summary financial charts with data on selected equity stocks as is of interest by our associate, Steve. The resulting charts generated from the VBA code was then used for comparison analysis of the various competitve stocks, then to be used for review of it's perfomrance in the specified years, and for financial planning for future investments. 
  Addtional purpose of the exercise was to create and develop proficiency with VBA by creating macros within Excel, utilizing For-loops, If-then statements, formatting the outputs within Excel sheets for readability, creating interactivity for ease-of-use, and to understand the value of refactoring the original code for increasing performance and reliability. 

### **Background**

  Steve requested assistance to evaluate green-energy stocks, based primarily on the investments of his parents into a single company's stock, named DAQO (ticker DQ). The single company investment is risky, and Steve wishes to evaluate several others stocks along-side DAQO so that he may discuss with his parents about diversifying investments into other companies to create a portfolio. Steve has obtained a data set of a couple years of the various stocks he wishes to evaluate, and data analysis and visualizations were perfomed.
  
  I addition, from this process the VBA macro was created as a portable financial tool that will allow Steve to quickly run the performance chart now and in the future on new data, as the years and companies to be evaluated will change. The below information is a result and summay of the using the new VBA tools.

## 2. Results 

  Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script. 
  The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script 


edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, youâ€™ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster.
